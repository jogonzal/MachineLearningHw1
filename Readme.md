Instructions:

1. Open the MachineLearningHw1\MachineLearningHw1.sln file using visual studio 2015 (community edition works fine)
2. Click run - you will have to put the testingD.arff and training_subsetD.arff in the root directory of this repository. The console agent will display a proper message if it can't find the files.
